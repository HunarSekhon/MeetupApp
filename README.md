# Astro

Astro is a twist on a meetup app that motivates you into planning meetups/events with incentives earning achievements while competing with others, ranking up... (to name a few) 



## Important: How to Run:
1. ```vagrant up```
2. ```vagrant ssh```
3. ```cd astro```
4. ```sudo meteor --allow-superuser``` (x2) - There is an issue with vagrant and meteor so you must run this command 2 times. It will fail the first time but succeed the second time
5. Go to localhost:8080



### Notes
